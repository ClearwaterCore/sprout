/// Quiescing is controlled by the QuiescingManager class.  This orchestrates
/// quiescing but doesn't actually do any of the heavy lifting.  This is done by
/// handlers that are registered with the manager:
/// -  Connections handler, which controls quiescing of TCP connections.
/// -  Flows handler, which controls quiescing of flows (edge proxy only).
/// -  Completion handler, which gets notified when quiescing is complete and
///    does any final clean up.
/// Each handler has an abstract base class which defines the interface that
/// the handler must implement.
///
/// When told to quiesce we first do any processing specific to an edge proxy
/// (bono) followed by processing common to bono and sprout. Specifically:
///
/// 1). Quiescing starts when quiesce() is called on the QuiescingManager.
/// 2). The untrusted port is closed
///     (QuiesceConnectionsInterface::close_untrusted_port).
/// 3). On an edge proxy, wait for flows to expire
///     (QuiesceFlowsInterface::quiesce).  Otherwise go to step 5.
/// 4). Once flows are quiesced, call flows_gone() on the QuiescingManager.
/// 5). The trusted port is closed
///     (QuiesceConnectionsInterface::close_trusted_port).
/// 6). Connections are quiesced.
///     (QuiesceConnectionsInterface::quiesce).
/// 7). Once all connections have been destroyed, call connections_gone() on
///     the QuiescingManager.
/// 8). Notify that quiescing has completed
///     (QuiesceCompletionInterface::quiesce_complete).
