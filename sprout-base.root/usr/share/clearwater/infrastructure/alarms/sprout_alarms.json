                    "action": "Use ENT logs to identify which Application Servers cannot be successfully communicated with and investigate the cause. It might be due to failure of an AS, misconfiguration of Initial Filter Criteria, or network / DNS problems. Once the issue has been resolved this alarm will clear after approximately 5-10 minutes."
